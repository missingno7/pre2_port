# PRE2 symbol / address ledger

Important original `PRE2.EXE` addresses, continuation points, and state locations
used by recovered code. The original binary/ASM is the oracle; entries here are
*candidates* until a verifier proves them.

Addresses are in the unpacked image (post-LZEXE); segment `1030` is the main game
code segment in the current VM layout, `1A13` is a fixed data segment.

**Columns:** location · name · confidence · role · verifier/test coverage · known unknowns.
**Confidence:** GUESS · OBSERVED · ASM_MATCHED · VERIFIED · CANONICAL.
**Role:** probe · checkpoint/verifier · replacement · data · canonical.

| `1030:00EC` / `00EF` | caller `call 1068` / return (`mov [3b],ax`) | ASM_MATCHED | (caller) | hook near-rets here via `cpu.pop()` | other callers (KEYB returns elsewhere) |
| `1030:10B4` | LZSS dispatch: `cmp ax,0x4cb4` (word[0]) | ASM_MATCHED | (branch) | dispatch matched in `unpack_sqz` | — |

| `1030:1401`–`148E` | LZSS header setup (17-byte header read, size/reserve calc, read-size `[13FD]`) | ASM_MATCHED | (setup) | `sqz_reserved_size()` | exact meaning of wrapper byte 9 (00/01) |

## Tooling notes

- Disassembly truth: use **capstone on dumped bytes**, not the VM trace
  disassembler (it mis-computes some `Jcc` targets).
- Oracle capture: single-step the original to a routine's `RET`, not for a fixed
  instruction budget (post-routine code can overwrite output before you read it).
- A guessed invariant is not a verifier: a "decode length == header size" contract
  once falsely condemned a *correct* LZSS decoder (the header field is the output
  *reservation*, not the decode length). The authority is the lockstep vs ASM.
