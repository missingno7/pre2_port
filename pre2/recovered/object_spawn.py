"""The object/effect spawner pre-amble (1030:6822) — the head that falls through into 684E (object_tick).

Run once per frame from the main-loop spine (0x0220), before the object-update walker. It dispatches three
game-mode-gated event/spawn routines, all of which call the shared list-initialiser 7585:

  * 70D7  if [0x91FE]!=0xFF   — the terrain-entity spawner (streams the 0x9107 list 4907 updates)
  * 6D34  if [0x2D8A]==5      — a mode-5 player-interaction event (unwitnessed)
  * 6ADD  if [0x2D8A]==9      — a mode-9 spawn event

Recovered leaf-first. ``rw``/``rb`` read DS words/bytes; each transform returns a ``{offset: (value, width)}``
write contract (the bridge applies it). Audio is a side-effect boundary: 7585 plays sound 0xD via 0x2CC, which
the live hook emits separately (like the other play_sfx seams) — it is outside the recovered list windows.
